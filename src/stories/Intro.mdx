## Getting Started

### Installation

For now, MinId Elements is available as a private package on GitHub. To install it, you'll first need to be part for the 'felleslosninger' organization, and then you'll need to configure your npm or yarn client to access the private repository.

**npm:**

1.  Create or edit your `~/.npmrc` file and add the following lines:

    ```plaintext
    //npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=[PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN]
    @felleslosninger:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/
    ```
    
2.  Replace `[PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN]` with your GitHub personal access token.

**yarn:**

1.  Create or edit your `~/.yarnrc.yaml` file and add the following:

    ```yaml
    npmScopes: {
      felleslosninger: {
        npmRegistryServer: "https://npm.pkg.github.com",
          npmAlwaysAuth: true,
          npmAuthToken: [PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN]
      }
    }
    ```
2. Replace [PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN] with your GitHub personal access token.

Once your client is configured, you can install the package using:
```bash
npm install @felleslosninger/minid-elements
```

or 

```bash
yarn add @felleslosninger/minid-elements
```

### CDN Usage
Alternatively, you can use MinId Elements directly from our CDN. Here's an example of how to include the components in your HTML file:
    
```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8">
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
      <title>MinID CDN Example</title>
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.minid.no/minid-elements/latest/index.css" />
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.minid.no/minid-elements/latest/theme/digdir/tokens.css" /> 
      <script type="module" src="https://cdn.minid.no/minid-elements/latest/index.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
      <mid-button>Click me</mid-button> 
    </body>
    </html>
```
This example demonstrates how to include the mid-button component. You can replace this with any other component from the MinId Elements library.
