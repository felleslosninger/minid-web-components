    <link
      rel="stylesheet"
      href="https://cdn.minid.no/minid-elements/latest/index.css"
    />
    <link
      rel="stylesheet"
      href="https://cdn.minid.no/minid-elements/latest/theme/digdir/tokens.css"
    />
    <script
      type="module"
      src="https://cdn.minid.no/minid-elements/latest/index.js"
    ></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <mid-button>Click me</mid-button>
